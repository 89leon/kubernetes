Kubernetes includes 'multiple components' that work together to provide the funcionality of a Kubernetes cluster.

The control plane components manage and control the cluster:
- etcd : Provides distributed , synchronized data storage for the cluster state.
- kube-apiserver: Serves the Kubernetes API , the primary interface for the cluster.
- kube-controller-manager : Bundles serveral components into one package.
- kube-scheduler: Schedules pods to run on individual nodes.

In addition to the control plane , each node also has:
- kubelet : Agent that executes containers on each node.
- kube-proxy: Handles network communication between nodes by adding firewall routing rules.


Here are the commands used in this lesson:

Get a list of system pods running in the cluster:
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
Check the status of the kubelet service:
sudo systemctl status kubelet
