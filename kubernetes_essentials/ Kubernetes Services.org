# Kubernetes Services
Services are another important component of deploting apps with Kubernetes.

Services allow you to dynamically access a group of replica pods.
Replica pods are often being created and destroyed , so what happend to other
pods or external entities which need to access thos pods?

A Service create an 'abstraction layer' on top of a set of replica pods. 
You can access the service rather that accessing the pods directly , so as pdos componentand go , you get ununterrupted ,
dynamic access to whatever replicas are up at the time.

| Cluster       |
| Server -> pod |
|        -> pod |
|        -> pod |

1.Create a NodePort service on top of your nginx pods:
##########################################################
cat << EOF | kubectl create -f -
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    nodePort: 30080
  type: NodePort
EOF


##########################################################
2.Get a list of services in the cluster.
##########################################################
kubectl get svc



You should see your service called nginx-service.
Since this is a NodePort service, you should be able to access it using port 30080 on any of your cluster's servers. You can test this with the command:
curl localhost:30080
You should get an HTML response from nginx!
