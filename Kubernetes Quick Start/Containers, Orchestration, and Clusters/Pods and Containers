In this lesson, we will explore pods, look at a Pod declaration file, and see how to declare and mount shared volumes. We will also see an example of how the containers share the IP space of the Pod and how we can go from the host node to the IP address of the Pod to see the output of the Pod's nginx instance.


kubectl create namespace podexample


The pod-example.yaml file

apiVersion: v1

    command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
    args:

         date >> /html/index.html;
         sleep 1;
