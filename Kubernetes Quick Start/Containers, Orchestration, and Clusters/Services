In this lesson, we will look at services in Kubernetes and how they allow us to provide high availability. We will see how labels are used to connect pods to services, and we will take a peek into DNS to see how using a service allows us to resolve a name to access groups of pods.

kubectl create -f ./service-example.yaml
kubectl describe service my-awesome-service
check the IP and curl it with correct PORT

service-example.yaml:

kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: my-awesome-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 32768
    targetPort: 80
