DevOps is a software engineering culture and practice that aims at unifying software
development (Dev) and software operation (Ops). DevOps aims at shorter development
cycles, increased deployment frequency and more dependable releases in close alignment
with business objectives.
DevOps is first and foremost a cultural movement. It is a culture of collaboration between developers and
operations people. This culture has given rise to a particular set of practices. DevOps is a grassroots movement. That means it started
from the bottom up. It's by practitioners, for practitioners, the people creating
the DevOps Movement and the people participating in the DevOps Movement are primarily those that are on
the ground doing the actual technical work of software development and system operations.

Let's talk for just a moment about what DevOps is not. Many people confuse DevOps with the set of tools that are associated
with DevOps, things like Jenkins, things like Ansible, things like Kubernetes.
And while these type of tools are essential in order to succeed with DevOps. DevOps is not a set of tools. It's a cultural
movement and those tools have been created as a result of that cultural movement. DevOps is
also not a standard. There are no standards in DevOps. There are some best practices that many different people and organizations tend to
follow. But there are no official standards set by the DevOps movement. DevOps is also not a product. While there are many companies
and individuals that have released products that support DevOps, DevOps itself is not a product. Again it's a cultural movement. And
finally, DevOps is not a job title.DevOps is a culture of collaboration between developers and system operations, people across an entire organization, not just certain
an entire organization, not just certain individuals or a single team or a single group.
