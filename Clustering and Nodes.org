Kubernetes implements a clustered architecture. In a typical production envionment , you will have 
multiple servers that are able to run your workloads (containers).

These servers which actually run the containers are called nodes.

A Kubernetes cluster has one orm ore 'control servers' which manage and control the cluster 
and host the Kubernetes API.
These control servers are ususally separate from worker nodes , which run applications
within the cluster.

| Controller                 | Worker | Worker |
| -------------------------- | ------ | ------ |
| Kubernetes API             | Pod    | Pod    |
| Other controler components | Pod    | Pod    |
|                            |        | Pod    |
